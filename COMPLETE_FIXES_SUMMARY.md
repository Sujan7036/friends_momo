# Database Column Fixes - Complete Summary

## ✅ FIXED: Staff Login Error

### **Problem:**
Staff login was failing with error:
```
Fatal error: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'final_amount' in 'field list'
```

### **Root Cause:**
The Order model was referencing database columns that don't exist in the actual schema.

## 🔧 Files Fixed

### 1. **models/Order.php**
**Fixed Non-Existing Columns:**
- ❌ `final_amount` → ✅ `total_amount`
- ❌ `discount_amount` → ✅ Removed (not in schema)
- ❌ `delivery_phone` → ✅ `customer_phone`

**Methods Updated:**
- `createOrder()` - Simplified for college project
- `getUserTotalSpent()` - Uses `total_amount` instead of `final_amount`
- `getOrderStatistics()` - Fixed revenue calculations
- `getDailySales()` - Fixed revenue calculations

### 2. **models/Reservation.php** 
**Fixed Column Mappings:**
- ❌ `name` → ✅ `customer_name`
- ❌ `email` → ✅ `customer_email`
- ❌ `phone` → ✅ `customer_phone`
- ❌ `guests` → ✅ `guest_count`

### 3. **views/public/reservation.php**
**Fixed Form Data Mapping:**
```php
// BEFORE (caused errors)
'name' => $name,
'email' => $email,
'phone' => $phone,
'guests' => $guests

// AFTER (works correctly)
'customer_name' => $name,
'customer_email' => $email,
'customer_phone' => $phone,
'guest_count' => $guests
```
